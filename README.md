## What makes name timeless or trendy?
Using data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a **hundred years** to understand American baby name tastes.

## Creating and importing data 

```
DROP TABLE baby_names;

CREATE TABLE baby_names (
  year INT,
  first_name VARCHAR(64),
  sex VARCHAR(64),
  num INT
);

\copy baby_names FROM 'usa_baby_names.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```
-----------------

------------------------
## 1 : looking at the names that have stood the test of time!
```
select first_name,sum(num)
from baby_names
-- Group by first_name and filter for those names that appear in all 101 years
group by first_name
having count(distinct year)>=101
-- Order by the total number of babies with that first_name, descending
order by sum(num) desc;
```

## 2 : Was the name classic and popular across many years or trendy, only popular for a few years? 
```
SELECT first_name, SUM(num),
    CASE WHEN COUNT(year) > 80 THEN 'Classic'
        WHEN COUNT(year) > 50 THEN 'Semi-classic'
        WHEN COUNT(year) > 20 THEN 'Semi-trendy'
        ELSE 'Trendy' END AS popularity_type
FROM baby_names
GROUP BY first_name
ORDER BY first_name;

```

FROM baby_names
WHERE sex = 'F'
GROUP BY first_name

ON subquery.year = b.year 
    AND subquery.max_num = b.num
ORDER BY year DESC;

WITH top_male_names AS (
    SELECT b.year, b.first_name, b.num
    FROM baby_names AS b
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT year, MAX(num) num
        FROM baby_names
        WHERE sex = 'M'
        GROUP BY year) AS subquery 
    ON subquery.year = b.year 
        AND subquery.num = b.num
    ORDER BY YEAR DESC
    )
